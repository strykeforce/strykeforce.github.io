      <description>This is the current state of the Third Coast Telemetry protocol between our grapher app written in LabView and our robot code written in Java.
See the thirdcoast-users Google Group for support.
Javadocs are here.
Network The grapher and robot communicate over two network channels, one for control and one for data.
The control channel is a HTTP REST web service that listens on robot TCP port 5800.
The data channel is for one-way graph data streaming from robot to grapher and listens on grapher workstation UDP port 5555.</description>

      <title>Third Coast Swerve Drive</title>

      <description>This software is designed to run on swerve drive hardware described in this paper. The swerve drive is controlled using the SwerveDrive class. Derivation of inverse kinematic equations are from Ether&amp;rsquo;s Swerve Kinematics and Programming.
The swerve-drive inverse kinematics algorithm will always calculate individual wheel angles as -0.5 to 0.5 rotations, measured clockwise with zero being the straight-ahead position. Wheel speed is calculated as 0 to 1 in the direction of the wheel angle.</description>

      <description>Talon Configurations Note: This library has seen some major changes as a result of the upgrade to CTRE Phoenix Toolkit in 2018.
Third Coast provides a library for storing any number of TalonSRX configurations in a TOML file and applying them to Talons. If this configuration file is not present on the roboRIO in the location you specify, a default configuration file stored in the robot application JAR is used.</description>

      <title>Android to roboRIO Networking</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve looked at a couple of methods for establishing a network connection over USB between an Android vision processor and our roboRIO. Two methods are using ADB for port-mapping and using Android USB tethering. This post describes our investigation of USB tethering.
Addresses The Android end of the tethered connection is hard-coded for 192.168.42.129 (see source code).</description>

      <description>Results from testing the digital outputs on the roboRIO.
Pulse Output The pulse length is set with a double and is passed to the FPGA where it is used to determine the pulse length. Calling DigitalOutput#pulse(double pulseLength) gives the following:
 pulseLength = 0.25: pulse width = 144 µsec pulseLength = 0.50: pulse width = 32 µsec pulseLength = 1.00: pulse width = 64 µsec pulseLength = 2.00: pulse width = 128 µsec pulseLength = 4.</description>

      <description>These are instructions for the 2767 team on how to configure easy SSH access to the roboRIO from macOS or Linux. (PuTTY instructions coming&amp;hellip;)
Linux and macOS In the steps below, $ is the command-line prompt and should not be typed when entering commands. Grab a mentor for a walk-through of these instructions if you need help!
 Verify you have a $HOME/.ssh directory and that it has permission of drwx------.</description>

      <description>While using FRC radios in the default configuration is easy to set up, having to connect to an isolated robot access point is inconvienient during development when Internet access is required. We have installed OpenWRT on the Open Mesh OM5P-AN used on our robots.
Diagram  Open Mesh OM5P-AN Radio The radio is configured using OpenWRT as a router with its WiFi interface connecting to our shop network with static IP address 192.</description>

      <title>Using Third Coast Telemetry with Swerve Drive</title>

      <description>Using the Third Coast Telemetry Service and Swerve Drive together relies on configuration using Dagger dependency injection. This allows for easy testing and reusable, interchangeable modules. The following code, taken from the example robot in this repository, configures the azimuth and drive Talons for monitoring.
public void robotInit() { try { RobotComponent component; // load config file or create from default resource file in jar  try (FileConfig toml = FileConfig.</description>

      <description>One of the benefits of using open data formats such as JSON and HTTP/REST is the ease with which we can develop client applications for Third Coast Telemetry. This is a simple demonstration client written in Python.
This is a sample of output when run with ./pygrapher 1 SETPOINT
 Pygrapher screen shot   Source Code #!/usr/bin/env python # usage: pygrapher &amp;lt;id&amp;gt; &amp;lt;measurement&amp;gt; # example: pygrapher 0 SETPOINT import sys import requests import socket import json import matplotlib.</description>
