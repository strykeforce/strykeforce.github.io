      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve looked at a couple of methods for establishing a network connection over USB between an Android vision processor and our roboRIO. Two methods are using ADB for port-mapping and using Android USB tethering. This post describes our investigation of USB tethering.
Android tethering over USB looks to be the best solution for us as we can set it up using the native RNDIS network driver on the roboRIO. No installation of adb required.</description>

      <description>While using FRC radios in the default configuration is easy to set up, having to connect to an isolated robot access point is inconvienient during development when Internet access is required. We have installed OpenWRT on the Open Mesh [OM5P-AN][om5p] used on our robots.
Diagram   Open Mesh OM5P-AN Radio The radio is configured using OpenWRT as a router with its WiFi interface connecting to our shop network with static IP address 192.</description>
