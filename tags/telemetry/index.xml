      <description>One of the benefits of using open data formats such as JSON and HTTP/REST is the ease with which we can develop client applications for Third Coast Telemetry. This is a simple demonstration client written in Python.
This is a sample of output when run with ./pygrapher 1 SETPOINT
 Pygrapher screen shot   Source Code #!/usr/bin/env python # usage: pygrapher &amp;lt;id&amp;gt; &amp;lt;measurement&amp;gt; # example: pygrapher 0 SETPOINT import sys import requests import socket import json import matplotlib.</description>

      <description>Status: DRAFT
This is the current state of the Third Coast Telemetry protocol between our grapher app written in LabView and our robot code written in Java.
Network The grapher and robot communicate over two network channels, one for control and one for data.
The control channel is a HTTP REST web service that listens on robot TCP port 5800.
The data channel is for one-way graph data streaming from robot to grapher and listens on grapher workstation UDP port 5555.</description>
