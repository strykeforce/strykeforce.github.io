      <description>Talon Configurations Third Coast provides a library for storing any number of Talon configurations in a TOML file and applying them to Talons. If this configuration file is not present on the roboRIO in the location you specify, a default configuration file stored in the robot application JAR is copied there. See the demonstration robot for an example of specifying a config file to use.
Javadocs are here.
Multiple Talon configurations can be stored in a TOML configuration file.</description>
