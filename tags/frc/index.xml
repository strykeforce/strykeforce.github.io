      <description>While using FRC radios in the default configuration is easy to set up, having to connect to an isolated robot access point is inconvienient during development when Internet access is required. We have installed OpenWRT on the Open Mesh OM5P-AN used on our robots.
Diagram  Open Mesh OM5P-AN Radio The radio is configured using OpenWRT as a router with its WiFi interface connecting to our shop network with static IP address 192.</description>

      <title>Using Third Coast Telemetry with Swerve Drive</title>

      <description>Using the Third Coast Telemetry Service and Swerve Drive together relies on configuration using Dagger dependency injection. This allows for easy testing and reusable, interchangeable modules. The following code, taken from the example robot in this repository, configures the azimuth and drive Talons for monitoring.
public void robotInit() { try { RobotComponent component; // load config file or create from default resource file in jar  try (FileConfig toml = FileConfig.</description>

      <description>This software is designed to run on swerve drive hardware described in this paper. The swerve drive is controlled using the SwerveDrive class. Derivation of inverse kinematic equations are from Ether&amp;rsquo;s Swerve Kinematics and Programming.
The swerve-drive inverse kinematics algorithm will always calculate individual wheel angles as -0.5 to 0.5 rotations, measured clockwise with zero being the straight-ahead position. Wheel speed is calculated as 0 to 1 in the direction of the wheel angle.</description>

      <description>These are instructions for the 2767 team on how to configure easy SSH access to the roboRIO from macOS or Linux. (PuTTY instructions coming&amp;hellip;)
Linux and macOS In the steps below, $ is the command-line prompt and should not be typed when entering commands. Grab a mentor for a walk-through of these instructions if you need help!

      <description>We use simulated telemetry data for client development, jar file available here here.
Example of use:
$ java -jar sim-v17.0.14.jar Creating simulated inventory... 0: Fake Talon 54 at 5 Hz 1: Fake Talon 57 at 3 Hz 2: Fake Talon 39 at 5 Hz 3: Fake Talon 45 at 1 Hz 4: Fake Talon 13 at 4 Hz 5: Fake Talon 52 at 3 Hz 6: Fake Talon 16 at 2 Hz 7: Fake Talon 46 at 2 Hz 8: Fake Servo 0 at 1 Hz 9: Fake Digital Input 0 at 1 Hz Measure signals are.</description>

      <description>One of the benefits of using open data formats such as JSON and HTTP/REST is the ease with which we can develop client applications for Third Coast Telemetry. This is a simple demonstration client written in Python.
This is a sample of output when run with ./pygrapher 1 SETPOINT

      <description>Status: DRAFT
This is the current state of the Third Coast Telemetry protocol between our grapher app written in LabView and our robot code written in Java.
Javadocs are here.
Network The grapher and robot communicate over two network channels, one for control and one for data.
The control channel is a HTTP REST web service that listens on robot TCP port 5800.
The data channel is for one-way graph data streaming from robot to grapher and listens on grapher workstation UDP port 5555.</description>

      <description>Talon Configurations Third Coast provides a library for storing any number of Talon configurations in a TOML file and applying them to Talons. If this configuration file is not present on the roboRIO in the location you specify, a default configuration file stored in the robot application JAR is copied there. See the demonstration robot for an example of specifying a config file to use.
Javadocs are here.
The structure of a Talon configuration file is:</description>
