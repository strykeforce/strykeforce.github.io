      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve looked at a couple of methods for establishing a network connection over USB between an Android vision processor and our roboRIO. Two methods are using ADB for port-mapping and using Android USB tethering. This post describes our investigation of USB tethering.
Addresses The Android end of the tethered connection is hard-coded for 192.168.42.129 (see source code).</description>

      <description>These are instructions for the 2767 team on how to configure easy SSH access to the roboRIO from macOS or Linux. (PuTTY instructions coming&amp;hellip;)
Linux and macOS In the steps below, $ is the command-line prompt and should not be typed when entering commands. Grab a mentor for a walk-through of these instructions if you need help!
 Verify you have a $HOME/.ssh directory and that it has permission of drwx------.</description>
